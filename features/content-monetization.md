# Content Monetization

Proof of Post revolutionizes creator monetization by enabling direct payments between users without platform fees or intermediaries. Creators can earn from their content through multiple mechanisms, all powered by Cardano's blockchain.

## üíé Paid Media System

### How It Works
Creators can monetize images and videos by setting custom prices in ADA:

1. **Content Upload**: Creator uploads image/video with monetization enabled
2. **Price Setting**: Set custom price in ADA for content access
3. **Preview Generation**: Blurred/watermarked preview shown to users
4. **Payment Processing**: Users pay ADA to unlock full content
5. **Blockchain Verification**: Payment verified on Cardano blockchain
6. **Content Delivery**: Full-resolution content delivered via signed URLs

### Creator Benefits
- **No Platform Fees**: Keep 100% of earnings (minus blockchain transaction fees)
- **Instant Payments**: Receive ADA directly to your wallet
- **Global Reach**: Accept payments from users worldwide
- **Flexible Pricing**: Set any price you want for your content
- **Content Protection**: Watermarked content prevents unauthorized sharing

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Create paid post
const createPaidPost = async (content: string, mediaFile: File, priceAda: number) => {
  // Upload media to IPFS
  const mediaCid = await uploadToIPFS(mediaFile);
  
  // Create payment intent
  const paymentIntent = await fetch('/api/payments/intent', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      content,
      mediaCid,
      priceLovelace: priceAda * 1_000_000 // Convert ADA to lovelace
    })
  });
  
  return paymentIntent.json();
};
```
